          What do we do with your personal information?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" color="text.primary">
          Your personal information could be used in the following ways:
          Processing your bookings: We use your personal information to ensure
          the services you’ve selected, which may include flights, hotels,
          transport, insurance, and other ancillary products are provided to
          you. We need certain information about you and your party so we can
          fulfil the contractual obligations when you make a booking. User
          Accounts: The information that you provide when you set up an account
          allows us to provide you with additional services including the
          ability to manage your bookings, personal settings, and access to
          special offers. To communicate with you about your booking: We’ll need
          to contact you using the email or telephone number you provided to
          give you information relevant to your arrangements. For example, to
          confirm your booking, notification of any changes, security alerts,
          administrative messages about your arrangements, and reminders.
          Customer Services: You can contact us at any time, whether this is a
          general query, a question about your booking, or to report an issue.
          You can do this through our website, by telephone or email. We’ll use
          the information that you’ve given us to answer any questions and
          respond to your query or other queries you might have in the future.
          If you do contact us by telephone, your call may be recorded and
          reviewed for quality and training purposes. Recordings are only kept
          for a limited period and then automatically deleted unless we have a
          legitimate interest in keeping them for a longer period.
          Personalization of your experience: We sometimes use your data to
          enable us to show you the most relevant products and services we think
          you’ll be interested in, such as the best deals and special offers for
          destinations you like or have been to previously. Marketing: Where you
          make a booking, or in any other case, if you have opted-in or
          signed-up, we may contact you with information about other products
          and services that we offer that are like those that you have already
          purchased or inquired about, and we think may interest you based on
          your personal information. Don’t worry, you can opt-out of these
          emails at any time. When you book or register with us, we will ask you
          if you would like to receive marketing communications. You can change
          your marketing preferences online, over the phone, using the
          “unsubscribe” link in our emails, replying STOP to the short code in
          our marketing text messages or by writing to us at any time. Of
          course, the choice is entirely yours, but if you say you do not want
          to receive marketing information from us you will miss out on
          receiving great offers and promotions that may be of interest to you.
          You may still receive service-related communications from us. For
          example, confirming bookings you make with us and providing important
          information about the use of our products and/or services. Promotional
          Activities: If you take part in any of our promotions (such as surveys
          or competitions) we will need to use the information you provide to
          run these promotions. Improving our services: Sometimes we might use
          your data to help us improve the quality and functionality of our
          services. This could include eliminating bugs in our system, data
          analysis, testing, and statistical and survey purposes, all of which
          helps us improve the service we offer. Security: We may use your data
          as part of efforts to keep our sites (and the information you provide
          to us) safe and secure, and to prevent fraud or unauthorized
          access/use of our sites. Fraudulent Claims: We may use your personal
          information to prevent, detect, or defend any claims/actions we
          believe to be potentially fraudulent or detrimental to our legitimate
          interests. Legal and regulatory compliance: We might need to use your
          information in relation to any legal disputes, regulatory, compliance
          or criminal investigations, or if necessary, to enforce our rights.

          such as hoteliers, airlines, insurers, and transfer providers to
          complete your booking contract. The data shared may include your name
          and the names and ages of any guests travelling with you, any
          preferences, or special requests you told us about when you made your
          booking and your contact details. If you contact us with a query about
          your booking, we may pass this on to our providers if they are needed
          to answer you. Third party support services: These includes anyone who
          provides support services or functions on our behalf, including
          payment card processing, business analytics, review agencies,

          not permitted to share or use information for any other purpose.
          Payment Processors and other financial institutions: When you make a
          payment on your booking, we use a third-party payment processor to
          take your payment. If you request a chargeback on your booking, it may
          be necessary for us to share certain details with the payment
          processor and the relevant financial institution, so they can manage
          the chargeback. This may include a copy of your booking confirmation,
          financial details and the IP address that was used to make your
          booking. Referring websites: If you were referred to our site via
          another webpage, we may share some information about you with that
          referring website so that they can contact you about their products
          and services, which may include Google Analytics. Business Affiliates:
          We may share your data with our business affiliates with whom we offer
          relevant joint services. This may include other agencies and
          advertising networks. We do this to maximize the services that we
          provide you and so they may contact you directly about their relevant
          products and services that may interest you. You can unsubscribe from
          these emails at any time. Law enforcement authorities: We will
          disclose personal information insofar as it is required by law or
          where we believe it is necessary for the prevention, detection, or
          prosecution of potentially criminal acts, including for fraud,
          immigration, customs, security, or anti-terrorism purposes. Please
          note that while we have procedures and security features to protect
          your information from access by unauthorized persons and against
          unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, and damage, we
          don’t control the privacy practices of any of these third-parties or
          your Service Providers and we would encourage you to review their own

          Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that
          tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to
          track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with
          other Google services. Google may use the collected data to
          contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

          analytics.js and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics
